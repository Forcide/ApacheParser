# ApacheParser
ApacheParser is a project made for school by Ramses 'Forcide' Houps.

This project parses the access log from the Apache Webserver.

It can give information about hosts that visited the Webserver or 404 status reports.

# Installation
No additional installation of modules needed.

To run the program, run:
'''
python3 main.py
'''

To use the mail function, create a gmail.txt file in the root of the project.
Insert your gmail username in the first line and password in the second line.
For example:
'''
gmailusername@gmail.com
gmailpassword
'''

# Testing
If you would like to test with a sample access log, simply create or copy the access log to the root of the project as 'access.log'

This will override the program to use that access log instead.
